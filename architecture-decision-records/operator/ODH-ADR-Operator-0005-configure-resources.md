## What

This document outlines design decision to introduce ability for user customizations of fields like resources and replicas.

## Why

ODH component deployments lack a mechanism for customizing resource limits, requests and deployment replicas. Deployment fields are hard-coded in the manifests with no means to adjust them according to user requirements.
We need a mechanism for users to configure resources when available resources are limited.

## Goals

* Enable the configuration of resource limits, requests and replicas for individual components. 
* Introduce an internal kustomize plugin that will whitelist fields like `replicas` and `resources`. This means any changes to these
fields will not be overwritten by the operator.
* We will not update or expose any fields

## Non-Goals

- This ADR will not define customization parameters other than `resources` and `replicas`.

## How

* Implementation for this will be done in two phases
  * Introduce customizations only in **Kserve** component. This is to address resource utilization [issues](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/issues/3467) in kserve.
  * Replicate the functionality in other components that require customization.
  * Kustomize [plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/tree/master/plugin/builtin) can be used to patch resources once deployed.
